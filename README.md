# Rock-Paper-Scissors

This project is a **multithreaded server-client** application built in Java for the **Rock-Paper-Scissors game**. The server is responsible for accepting multiple client connections, handling communication between them, and managing the game state. The client can interact with the server to play the game.

## Project Overview

The **Rock-Paper-Scissors** game server provides a platform where multiple users can play the game against each other. It features:
- Client-server communication over **TCP sockets**.
- Multithreaded handling of multiple users.
- Logging of server and client activities.
- Proper management of client connections.

## Features

- **Multithreaded server**: Each client is handled in a separate thread, allowing multiple concurrent connections.
- **Game logic**: The server contains the rules for the game and determines the winner.
- **Logging**: Server and client activity are logged for debugging and monitoring purposes.
- **Client Interaction**: Clients can send messages to the server and receive responses to play the game.
- **Connection Management**: The server monitors and handles new client connections.

## Technologies Used

- **Java**: The core language for server and client implementation.
- **TCP/IP**: For communication between server and client.
- **Multithreading**: To handle multiple clients simultaneously.
- **Logging**: For monitoring and debugging server activity.
